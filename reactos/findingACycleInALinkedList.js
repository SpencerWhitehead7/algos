// Finding a cycle in a Linked List
// Slides

// Prompt
// Given the head of a singly linked list, determine if there is a cycle within the linked list. If there is a cycle, return true and log the length of the cycle and the first node in the cycle. If there is no cycle, return false.

// Caveat: you may not use any additional data structures, nor may you modify the existing data structure. No arrays, no objects, no maps, no linked lists, etc.

// Remember: The nodes in the linked list can have the same values.

// Setup
// See slides for diagrams and hints!
