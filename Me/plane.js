// Write a function that takes a number and a string.
// The number represents the number of rows on a plane. Each row is arranged into three "blocks" like this:

// ABC DEFG HJK ("I" ommitted for clarity)

// the string represents reserved seats, separated by spaces, in this format RowSeatletter (i.e., 1A or 3F or 10K)

// VERSION 1: the function should return the number of FULL 3-seat "blocks" on the plane. If DEFG are all occupied, only count it as ONE full block.

// VERSION 2: the function should return the number of EMPTY 3-seat "blocks" on the plane. If DEFG are all empty, only count it as ONE empty block.
