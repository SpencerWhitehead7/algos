// You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

// Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

// You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

// Example:

// Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

// call isBadVersion(3) -> false
// call isBadVersion(5) -> true
// call isBadVersion(4) -> true

// Then 4 is the first bad version.
