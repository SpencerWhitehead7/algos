You have maybe done a bunch of algorithms from different websites and gotten frustrated trying to sort them or find old ones or remember what you did where, and thought to yourself "It sure would be convenient if all the prompts and solutions were in the same place I could access offline, like for instance a folder and if I also had a repo for them so I could share them or download them to another computer."

Well, I went and did it.

The folders are named for the websites where I found the problems and the files are the names of the problems.
